    "Our target is to predict how likely a \"young person\" would be interested in shopping at a large shopping center. We were not given details about what a \"large\" shopping center, but searching online for malls led us to the Avion Shopping Park in Ru≈æinov, Slovakia. It has an area of 103,000m<sup>2</sup> and is the largest shopping mall in Slovakia (https://www.avion.sk/sk-sk/about-the-centre/fakty-a-cisla). \n",

This information would be of great interest to any commercial devlopment firm deciding on where to build their next shopping center or place of business. This could also help other parties trying to purchase real estate for youth-orientated construction (parks, recreation centers)."
